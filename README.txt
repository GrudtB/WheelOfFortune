Welcome to Wheel of Fortune!

This is a game based on the Wheel of Fortune gameshow. Three players compete to guess a word.
A wheel is spun that has 24 segments. The values of the 24 segments are between $100 and $900. The wheel also includes Bankrupt and Lose a Turn.

On their turn, players can spin a wheel and guess a consonant. For each consonant in the word a money prize is awarded.
Players can also guess the entire word.
After a consonant has been guessed players can buy a vowel.

After two rounds, the player with the highest accumulated cash moves into the final round.
A selection of consonants and vowels are revealed for the player and they have 2 more consonant guesses and a vowel guess.
If they correctly guess within that frame a cash prize is awarded.

I hope you enjoy the game!
